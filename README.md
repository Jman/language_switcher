# Language Switcher

Extension for Google Chrome that switch Accept-Language header globaly or per site.
Switching headers globaly is good for developing/testing multilingual websites and webapps.
Switching per site good is good for everyday surfing, as example if the site translation is not ready and you may see bilingual content, best way to switch it to default locale.
